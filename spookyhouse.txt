On Halloween night, my friends and I decided to visit the old, <adjective> mansion at the end of the street. 
Legend has it that a <noun> haunts the place. 
As we approached the house, we heard a(n) <adjective> sound coming from inside. We opened the <noun> and stepped into the <adjective> hallway. 
Suddenly, a <noun> fell from the ceiling, making us all <verb> in fear. 
We continued exploring and found a room filled with <plural noun>. 
In the end, we discovered that the noises were just a(n) <noun> playing tricks on us. 
It was a <adjective> night we would never forget.
